# BookMark
A BookMark app feat. [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS (no framework!).

IMPLEMENTATION:
* we added an `SVG` as a hero image because an svg can scale upto any size according as the size of the viewport.
* Then we start building `Bookmark UI` which'll be served & inserted by javascript later on the submission of `modal-form`.
* Next we start building our `modal` which pops up on the click on `ADD BOOKMARK` button.
* Now a `modal` consists of two different parts - an `overlay` that darken everything behind it and the `modal` itself.
